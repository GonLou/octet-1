Buildings heigth will be random (a neighbour calculation will ensure not great heigth discrepancies).  
After the city construction a ball is launched and by the force of player (controlled by arrow keys) avoid to collide with buildings.  
A score will be recorded in Hall of Fame. This HoF is recorded in a text file and readed every time game ends.

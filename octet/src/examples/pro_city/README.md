This assignment is planned to create a procedural city from a road structure.
Buildings heigth will be random (a neighbour calculation will ensure not great heigth discrepancies), but their disposition will be along roads.
After the city construction a ball is launched and by the inclination of the plane (controlled by keypad) tries to destroy the maximum number of possible buildings.
A score will ensure your name in Hall of Fame. This HoF is recorded in a text file and readed every time game runs.
